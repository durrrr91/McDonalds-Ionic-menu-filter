# McDonald's Ionic menu filter

This app allows you to filter McDonalds menu items by name, calories, total fat, carbohydrates or protein. You can also:

  - Favourite items (swipe left on an item)
  - Delete items* (use the delete icon on the top left)

*Deleted items are not saved in the database so they can be back after a refresh. Scroll list up to refresh.
Firebase is used to store the sample data and user favourites.
